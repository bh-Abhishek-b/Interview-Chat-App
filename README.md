# Interview_chat_app
This project aims to develop an interactive Streamlit chatbot application designed for conducting user interviews. The chatbot engages users in an interview-style conversation, beginning with an introduction and proceeding to inquire about the specific job role the user is seeking an interview for, such as HR manager, Developer, Project Manager, and more.

Key Features
1. User Introduction
The chatbot initiates the interaction by prompting users to introduce themselves, setting the stage for the interview process.

2. Job Role Selection
Users are guided through selecting the job role they are being interviewed for, enabling tailored questioning.

3. Tailored Questions
Based on the selected job role, the chatbot presents 3-4 role-specific questions, ensuring relevancy and depth in the interview process.

4. Contextual Follow-ups
Leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's API and LangChain, the chatbot dynamically generates follow-up questions based on the user's responses and the chosen job role. This enables a more fluid and personalized interview experience.

5. Feedback Provision
To conclude the interview, the chatbot offers concise feedback on the user's performance, providing insights and potential areas for improvement.

6. Exit Chat Option
An "exit chat" button is integrated into the application, allowing users to clear the conversation. This feature ensures a seamless transition for new users to begin their interview afresh.
