# Interview_chat_app
This project aims to develop an interactive Streamlit chatbot application designed for conducting user interviews. The chatbot engages users in an interview-style conversation, beginning with an introduction and proceeding to inquire about the specific job role the user is seeking an interview for, such as HR manager, Developer, Project Manager, and more.
